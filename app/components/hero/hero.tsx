          Hello, my name is Abdul Wasay. I am a detail-oriented professional
          with a background in computer science and a passion for programming.
          With a focus on TypeScript and MS Excel, I aim to create efficient,
          scalable solutions that drive impactful results.

          I have experience building projects such as a Countdown Timer and an
          Interactive Resume Builder during hackathons and challenges,
          showcasing my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail. My
          journey in tech has been shaped by continuous learning, practical
          coding experiences, and hands-on project development.

          I'm currently expanding my skill set by exploring Next.js and
          developing my own portfolio website, where I showcase my skills in web
          development, including HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and React. I love
          experimenting with new ideas, and Iâ€™m always eager to take on
          challenging projects that allow me to grow both personally and
          professionally.
